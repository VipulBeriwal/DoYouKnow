Before actual transfer of data, there are three major steps than happen between client and server.

1. Certificate Validation.
The server has its "Root Certificate" which is signed by a Certiticate Authority(CA). CA signs the certificate by its private key but 
this certificate contains public key and identity of the server. When client asks for certificate from the server, it will loop through the
saved public keys(in browser) to unlock the certificate from any one of the CA. Since the server certificate is signed by the private key it 
can only be checked by public key of same CA. Any other cannot encrypt the certificate beacuse it will not match the public key pair(we cannot
do the reverse process).




2. Asymmetric Communication
Once the client finds it valid certificate, then the key exchange process is started. To have shared secret key(symmetric key), they 
chat using temp private-public key pair(asymmetric key). 
First, client give its public key to server(Client-PubK). Server will merge the Client-PubK with its private key and send the merged key to
the client. Client will again merge it with its own private key. Thus, Client-Private key will nullify the effect of Client-PubK key 
(as a compliment) and only thing will left in that mixture is private key of server. Thus, client obtains the private key of server. 
The same process happens with the server and server obtains the private key of the client. 





3. Symmetric Communication
Now, both client and server will merge the private keys of both of them to make a shared private key. Then, the main sharing of the
information starts. Since, this is secret key, only these both decrypt the encrpted messages.
